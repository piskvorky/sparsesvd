Changes
=======

0.1.6

* added a license: Free BSD
* moved hosting to github

0.1.5

* fixed a bug deep inside SVDLIBC, where a global error flag was not being reset
  before: zero input matrix=>global error flag set + memory leak + all subsequent calls to sparsesvd() terminate early
  now: the error flag is reset before each call; zero input matrix correctly returns zero factors

  thanks to Peter Prettenhofer for reporting the bug

0.1.4

* minor edits in docstrings and setup.py

0.1.3

* removed (commented out) all code paths that performed any I/O
* removed unneeded *.h headers, improving portability (mainly for Windows compilation)
